## Project Background

This project was created to solve a specific problem: my friend and I wanted to compete on completing daily habits. I built this as a full-stack solution to improve my MongoDB and Mongoose skills while creating a functional application for habit tracking competitions.

The architecture uses separate schemas for users, challenges, and habits that work together seamlessly. The React frontend provides an intuitive interface, while the Node.js/Express backend with Mongoose manages all data persistence and relationships.
